# Notebook
### A web app for storing your notes

Each person can have an account. When you create a notebook, it belongs to you. No one else can see it.
## Entries
Within notebooks, you can create entries. There is no real limit to how long an entry can be.
## Markdown
Markdown is supported. This project uses the Showdown markdown parser with header IDs disabled and emojis enabled.
